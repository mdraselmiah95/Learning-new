OOP => Object-Oriented Programming
POP => Procedure-Oriented Programming



| Feature             | OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)            | POP (Procedure-Oriented Programming)             |

| Approach            | Based on objects and classes                 | Based on procedures/functions              |
| Focus               | Focuses on data and behavior (methods)       | Focuses on functions and the flow of actions |
| Data Security       | Encapsulation helps protect data             | Data is generally exposed to all functions       |
| Modularity          | Code is organized into reusable objects      | Code is organized into functions            |
| Scalability         | More suitable for large and complex programs | Better for smaller and straightforward programs  |
| Reusability         | Promotes reusability via inheritance         | Less reusability; functions must be rewritten    |
| Examples            | C++, Java, Python (OOP), C#, Ruby            | C, Pascal, early versions of BASIC               |
| Real-world Modeling | Models real-world entities using objects     | Harder to model real-world entities              |
